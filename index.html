<p>Tucan has be created to make site development simple and super easy within teams (especially agile). It runs on a flat-file database to ensure both portability and speed but if you prefer SQL, you can easily write that in. The backend of Tucan is dead simple, you have pages which consist of components, which contain a single HTML (Twig template) file, variables and resources (JS, CSS). Within the backend is also Components and Variables (as mentioned) as well as Users to allow you to manage roles and give your team access.</p>

<h3><a id="tucan-works-around-you" class="anchor" href="#tucan-works-around-you" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tucan works around you.</h3>

<p>When I decided to build Tucan I had a number of years of frontend (and backend) knowledge behind me and had been working with a number of content management systems that really didn't work for me. Whether it was because they were bloated with lots of extra <i>functionality</i> I didn't need or ever use or because I had to rewrite all of my code to fit the system, often having to learn the codebase.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
