<h3><a id="its-simple-really-simple" class="anchor" href="#its-simple-really-simple" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>It's simple, really simple.</h3>

<p>Tucan has be created to make site development simple and super easy within teams (especially agile). It runs on a flat-file database to ensure both portability and speed but if you prefer SQL, you can easily write that in. The backend of Tucan is dead simple, you have pages which consist of components, which contain a single HTML (Twig template) file, variables and resources (JS, CSS). Within the backend is also Components and Variables (as mentioned) as well as Users to allow you to manage roles and give your team access.</p>

<h3><a id="tucan-works-around-you" class="anchor" href="#tucan-works-around-you" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tucan works around you.</h3>

<p>When I decided to build Tucan I had a number of years of frontend (and backend) knowledge behind me and had been working with a number of content management systems that really didn't work for me. Whether it was because they were bloated with lots of extra <i>functionality</i> I didn't need or ever use or because I had to rewrite all of my code to fit the system, often having to learn the codebase.</p>


<h3>
<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To get started with Tucan you need to download the code from the Github repository (see left) and set the <code>*.db</code> files located in <code>/app/db/</code> to readable, you can do this in your SSH/Terminal window using <code>chmod</code> or through your FTP client. Next you will need to go ahead and edit your <code>tucan.json</code> file within <code>/app/config/</code> to reflect the sites setup and extra values - from here you can turn on <code>debug</code> to show output errors, set the backend login URL (default is <code>/admin</code>), add Google Analytics tracking and a bunch of other important stuff.</p>

<p>When you first login, your default credentials are as follows, please change them as soon as you're in to stop anyone having admin access to your Tucan installation!</p>

<pre>
  Username: admin
  Password: admin
</pre>

<p>Once you are in you can now setup users and start setting up your website!</p>

<h3>
<a id="its-all-about-components-baby" class="anchor" href="#its-all-about-components-baby" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>It's all about Components, baby.</h3>

<p>Components are the building blocks of your site, they are slices of code that can be used through multiple pages with unique content, editable on a page by page basis, best of all it stops you repeating parts of the site and having code duplication! A dead simple example of a component is a header that might be used on your homepage, gallery and contact us page:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!-- heroHeader --&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;heroHeader&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- heroHeader --&gt;
</pre>

<p>It's always good practice to add comments into your components both above and below containing the name of your componentsso that you can easily debug from the frontend. Adding the name into your class, this makes it a lot easier to write CSS.</p>

<h3>
<a id="so-pages" class="anchor" href="#so-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So, Pages.</h3>

<p>No longer do you have to use articles, posts, containers or publications, all of your pages are, well, pages. </p>
